# Drop Table Builder

The time taken to scrape the wiki for gathering clue scroll drop data took too long to be included in the Drop Simulator plugin. To remedy this, this python script creates a small .sqlite file with all cllue scroll data to be included in the plugin. This script can be ran to update the databse upon any changes to these tables. For now, it only gathers clue scroll data but in the future it will gather all of the non-npc drop data.

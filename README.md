# Drop Table Builder

The time taken to scrape the wiki for gathering clue scroll drop data took too long to be included in the Drop Simulator plugin. To remedy this, this python script creates a small .json file for each non npc drop table to be included in the plugin. This script can be ran to update the database upon any changes to these tables.
